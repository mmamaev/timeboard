class Workshift(object):
    """A period of time during which a business agent is either on or off duty. 
    
    A workshift consists of at least one base unit and may span 
    a number of consecutive base units. 
    
    Each workshift has a label. The label is interpreted by a given schedule 
    to determine whether the workshift is on duty or off duty under this 
    schedule.  The duty statuses of the same workshift can be different 
    under different schedules.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    timeboard : :py:class:`.Timeboard`
    location : int >=0
        Position of the workshift on the timeline of the timeboard (zero-based).
    schedule : _Schedule, optional
        If not given, the timeboard's default schedule is used. 
        
    Raises
    ------
    OutOfBoundsError
        If `location` points outside the timeboard or is negative.
        
    Attributes
    ----------
    
    start_time : Timestamp
        When the workshift starts (the start time of workshift's first 
        base unit).
    end_time : Timestamp
        When the workshift ends (the end time of workshift's last base unit).
    duration : int >0
        Number of base units in the workshift.
    label
        An application-specific label associated with the workshift. 
        Schedule's `selector` interprets the label to identify the duty status
        of the workshift under this schedule.
    schedule : _Schedule
        Schedule used by workshift's methods unless explicitly redefined in 
        the method call. Use `name` attribute of `schedule` to review its 
        identity.

        Raises
        ------
        OutOfBoundsError
            If the method attempted to roll outside the timeboard.

        Notes
        -----
        The method is executed in two stages. The first stage finds the 
        workshift corresponding to step 0. The second stage fulfills the 
        required number of steps (if any) starting from the zero step 
        workshift.
        
        If self has the same duty as specified by `duty` parameter, then 
        the zero step workshift is self, otherwise, it is the first workshift 
        toward the future which conforms to `duty` parameter. If `steps`=0,
        the method terminates here and returns the zero step workshift.
         
        If `steps` is positive, the method counts workshifts toward the future
        stepping only on workshifts with the specified duty and returns the 
        last workshift on which it has stepped. For example, with `steps`=1 the 
        method returns the workshift following the zero step workshift, 
        subject to duty.
        
        If `steps` is negative, the method works in the same way but moving
        toward the past from the zero step workshift. For example, with 
        `steps`=-1 the method returns the workshift preceding the zero step 
        workshift, subject to duty. 
        
        Note that the zero step workshift is sought toward the future 
        even if `steps` is negative.

            definition of the zero step workshift and the default direction 
            of stepping.

        >>> ws0.rollforward(1, duty='off')
        Workshift(8) of 'D' at 2017-10-08
        >>> ws0.rollforward(-1, duty='off')
        Workshift(4) of 'D' at 2017-10-04
        
        Note that ``ws0.rollforward(-1)`` and ``ws0 - 1`` produce different 
        results:

        >>> ws0.rollforward(-1)
        Workshift(5) of 'D' at 2017-10-05
        >>> ws0 - 1
        Workshift(3) of 'D' at 2017-10-03
        
        This happens because ``ws0.rollforward(-1)`` assumes the default 
        `duty='on'` and seeks the zero step on-duty workshift by moving 
        forward from the off-duty self (October 6). Thus the zero step workshift 
        will be October 7. From that point the method takes one on-duty step 
        to the past and arrives at October 5 which is the result.
        
        On the contrary, ``ws0 - 1`` calls ``ws0.rollback(1, duty='on')`` 
        which seeks the zero step on-duty workshift by moving backward from
        self. Thus the zero step workshift will be October 5, and one on-duty 
        step to the past from that will be the result, October 3.

        Note that ``ws0.rollback(-1)`` and ``ws0 + 1`` produce different 
        results:
        
        >>> ws0.rollback(-1)
        Workshift(7) of 'D' at 2017-10-07
        >>> ws0 + 1
        Workshift(9) of 'D' at 2017-10-09
        
        This happens because ``ws0.rollback(-1)`` assumes the default 
        `duty='on'` and seeks the zero step on-duty workshift by moving 
        backwards from the off-duty self (October 6). Thus the zero step 
        workshift will be October 5. From that point the method takes one 
        on-duty step to the future and arrives at October 7 which is the 
        result.
        
        On the contrary, ``ws0 + 1`` calls ``ws0.rollforward(1, duty='on')`` 
        which seeks the zero step on-duty workshift by moving forward from
        self. Thus the zero step workshift will be October 7, and one on-duty 
        step to the future from that will be the result, October 9.

        The source for the work time value is determined by

        Parameters
        ----------
        duty : {``'on'``, ``'off'``, ``'any'``} , optional (default ``'on'``)
            Specify the duty of the worker.
        schedule : _Schedule, optional
            If `schedule` is not given, the interval's schedule is used to 
            determine the duty.

        Returns
        -------
        int or float
            Either workshift's duration or label, depending on the value
            of `worktime_source`. However, if the workshift's duty 
            is not the same as worker's `duty`, zero is returned.

        ------
        TypeError
            If `worktime_source`='labels' but the workshift's label is not 
            a number.
            
        Examples
        --------
        By default, the work time equals to workshift's duration:

        >>> clnd = tb.Timeboard('D', '30 Sep 2017', '11 Oct 2017', 
        ...                     layout=[4, 8, 4, 8],
        ...                     default_selector = lambda label: label>4)

        >>> ws.label

        >>> ws.duration
        1
        >>> ws.is_on_duty()
        True
        >>> ws.worktime()
        1
        >>> ws.worktime(duty='off')
        0
        >>> ws.worktime(duty='any')
        1

        In the example below, the work time is taken from the labels:

        >>> clnd = tb.Timeboard('D', '30 Sep 2017', '11 Oct 2017',
